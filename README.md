# 📈 Sales Forecasting

A production-ready time series forecasting pipeline built with [Meta Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), designed to help retailers **optimize inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies**. This project demonstrates how daily sales can be forecasted using a mix of **historical transactions**, **external economic signals**, and **seasonal effects** — all in a modular, interpretable, and scalable workflow.

## 🎯 Business Context

In fast-paced retail environments, poor sales forecasting leads to **stockouts**, **excess inventory**, and **inefficient staffing** — all of which hurt both revenue and customer satisfaction.  

This project enables retail teams to:

- Plan promotions and product availability more precisely  
- Align staffing and procurement with expected sales demand  
- Respond to external signals like oil price trends and holiday seasonality  
- Improve supply chain and warehouse utilization

## ✨ Project Highlights

- 📆 Forecasted daily sales across 54 stores and multiple product families  
- 🌍 Integrated oil prices, national holidays, and store-level transactions as external regressors  
- ⚙️ Built a reusable forecasting pipeline using Prophet in Python  
- 📊 Evaluated accuracy using MAE and RMSE for business-ready insights  
- 🧩 Easily extendable to other retail or time series forecasting use cases
